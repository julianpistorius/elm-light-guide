Whenever this chapter refers to command. That is a Light Table command which you may \(and probably should\) provide a custom keyboard shortcut to.

**To define a shortcut in Light Table:**

1. Open the command bar \(ctrl-space\)
2. Search and find `Settungs: User keymap` and select that
3. Define your shortcuts as per the example below

`[:editor "alt-enter" :editor.linter.details]  ;; command to display details for a marked error or warning after linting`

To view all available commands and suggestions tips on how you might want to do more advanced configurations, check out the [Reference chapter](/reference.md)
